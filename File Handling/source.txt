File Handling in Programming

File handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows us to work with files on a computer system. It enables us to perform various operations such as reading from files, writing to files, and managing file data.

Key Concepts in File Handling:

1. File Opening

   - Can read line by line
   - Useful for processing large data files

3. Writing Files
   - Creates new files or overwrites existing ones
   - Can write text or data in specific formats
   - Important for saving program output

4. File Management

   - Moving or renaming files
   - Managing file permissions

Common File Operations:
- Creating new files
